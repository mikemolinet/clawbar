# ClawBar — TODO

## Polish & Distribution
- [ ] **App icon** — custom lobster icon instead of default macOS icon
- [ ] **Code signing + notarization** — $99/yr Apple Developer account, eliminates Gatekeeper "Open Anyway" friction. Check if we already have one from iOS app work. Sign + notarize = zero warnings on download.
- [ ] **Homebrew cask** — `brew install --cask clawbar` for easy install
- [ ] **Auto-update** — Sparkle framework or similar, so users get new versions without re-downloading

## Done ✅
- [x] v1.0.0 released — DMG on GitHub Releases
- [x] Public repo with README + screenshot
- [x] Security audit passed — no secrets in repo
- [x] Per-session notifications with cooldowns
- [x] 90% compaction threshold marker
- [x] Sound toggle in settings
- [x] Launch at login
- [x] Multi-session support
